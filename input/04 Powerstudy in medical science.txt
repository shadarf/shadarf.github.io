A typical clinical trial requires 80% power at a significance level of 5%. 𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒅𝒐𝒏’𝒕 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒄𝒉 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒍𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍 𝒐𝒇 𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍 𝒑𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓* - whether it is due to ethical reasons, logistical obstacles, or budgetary limits?

In a recent conversation with Justin Bélair, Robert Rachford provided a clear and concise answer. I encourage you to watch the entire video; it is only 1 minute and 23 seconds long, and it is well worth your time.

Robert is the Founder of Better Biostatistics, a website with free resources to learn about biostatistics and statistical programming.

Justin is a statistics and biostatistics consultant. He is also the Founder and Editor of biostatistics.ca, a website that contains many articles and guides about biostatistics.

I am voluntarily endorsing this video without any compensation from Justin or Robert. I have become acquainted with both of them through my writing on LinkedIn, but they did not ask me to share their content in any way. I am recommending this video because I think that it is helpful.


*I wrote an earlier post to introduce what statistical power is, and it featured another short video conversation between Justin and Robert. If you are unfamiliar with this concept, I encourage you to read that post first: https://lnkd.in/gDXhu2tM
