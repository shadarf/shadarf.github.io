Breakthrough:
BCI + AI = Instant mind-to-speech conversion

A new device can detect words and turn them into speech within three seconds.


üìç The researchers used deep learning RNN-T models to achieve fluent speech synthesis with a large-vocabulary with neural decoding in 80-ms increments.

In the study, Ann was a participant who lost her ability to speak after a stroke 18 years ago. Researchers used paper-thin rectangle containing 253 electrodes on the surface on her brain cortex (speech sensorimotor area) to record the activity of thousands of neurons.

Researchers even personalized the synthetic voice! They used AI on recordings from her wedding video. As a result, the synthetic voice sounds like Ann‚Äôs own voice from before her injury.


‚ùó The result:

Before:  a single sentence took >20 seconds.

Now: 47 - 90 words per minute.


‚ÄúOur framework also successfully generalized to other silent-speech interfaces, including single-unit recordings and electromyography. Our findings introduce a speech-neuroprosthetic paradigm to restore naturalistic spoken communication to people with paralysis.‚Äù

Huge congratulations to the authors of this work!

Just WOW.
