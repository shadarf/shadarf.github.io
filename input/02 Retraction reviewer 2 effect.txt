This retraction highlights a serious breach of research integrity. Reviewers pressured authors to add irrelevant citations, compromising the peer review process. However, the authors also bear responsibility they complied instead of rejecting unethical demands.

Why did they not refuse? Likely to secure publication. This reflects a broader issue: the pressure to publish leading to ethical compromises. Both reviewers and authors must be held accountable to maintain scientific integrity. Peer review should ensure quality, not serve as a tool for citation manipulation.
